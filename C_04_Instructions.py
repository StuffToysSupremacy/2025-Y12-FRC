    - The costs for each component of the product 
      (variable expenses)
    - Whether or not you have fixed expenses (if you have 
      fixed expenses, it will ask you what they are).
    - How much money you want to make (ie: your profit goal)

It will also ask you how much the recommended sales price should 
be rounded to.

The program outputs an itemised list of the variable and fixed 
expenses (which includes the subtotals for these expenses). 

Finally it will tell you how much you should sell each item for 
to reach your profit goal. 

The data will also be written to a text file which has the 
same name as your product and today's date.
